    "Efficient and accurate anemia detection, coupled with precise severity measurement, presents a critical challenge in modern healthcare, especially in the context of Kenya's medical landscape. The current diagnostic tools lack the precision needed for early identification, leading to delayed interventions, suboptimal patient outcomes, and escalated healthcare costs due to preventable hospitalizations. In response to this, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), commissioned by the Ministry of Health (MOH), is embarking on a pioneering project. Our goal is to develop predictive models utilizing comprehensive blood count (CBC) parameters, age, and gender data, harnessing the power of machine learning. These models will ease the identification of anemia, to the benefit of patients, healthcare proffesionals, KEMRi and the MOH. Solving this problem may significantly enhance patient care, improve medical decision-making, and alleviate healthcare burdens, contributing data-driven insights to inform healthcare policies and strategies."
