    "The Kenya Medical Research Institute(KEMRI) is a state corporation established in Kenya in 1979 through the Science and Technology Act, Cap 250 of the Laws of Kenya. It operates under the Science Technology and Innovation Act, 2013 as the national body responsible for carrying out research in human health in Kenya. KEMRI is the medical research arm of the government and provides advice to the Ministry of Health(MOH) on various aspects of healthcare and delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "KEMRI's mission is to improve human health and quality of life through research , capacity builging , innovation and service delivery. The Institute conducts research under seven research programs including Biotechnology, Public Health and Health Systems, Sexual Reproductive Adolescent and Child health,Natural Products and Drug Development, Infectios and Parasitic Diseases and Non-Communicable Diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Health Sector, KEMRI is responsible for providing leadership in health research and development, shaping the health research agenga, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, monitoring and assessing health trends as well as dealing with trans-boundary threats and disease outbreaks. The institute further continues to be responsive the challenges of emerging and re-emerging diseases including Non-Communicable Diseases and communicable conditions and bio-terrorism.\n",

    "Anemia is one of the diseaes that have posed a significant public health problem. Anemia is a condition in which the body lacks enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. According to the World Health Organization, anemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children, mensturating adolescent girls, pregnant and postpaturm women.Anemia can be classified in three different levels based on its severity. The severity of the anemia is determined by measuring the level of haemoglobin in the blood.These levels are mild,moderate and severe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to develop predictive models utilizing factors such as Red blood Cell count,age, sex,white bllod cell count etc to help predict the presence of anemia and its severity in different persons. By critically analyzing this different factors we will be able to help KEMRI which was commisioned by the Ministry of Health to improve on the current diagnostic tools on anemia detection in terms of efficiency and accuracy. By doing this we aim to encourage accurate early predictions which may ultimately lead to accelerated interventions.\n",
